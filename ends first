Great! I see your hand-drawn timeline. Let's break it down step-by-step and solve the **activity selection problem** visually based on your image.

---

### ✅ Problem Restated (from your diagram):

* We have **only one classroom**, and multiple people want to use it at different **time intervals**.
* Our goal is to **maximize the number of non-overlapping requests** (i.e., schedule as many as possible).
* ✅ = selected (you've ticked a few)
* 🕓 Time runs from **1 to 19** at the bottom.
* Each block = a class request with a start and end time.
* Overlaps = can’t take both.

---

### ✍️ Step 1: Convert to intervals

From your image, here's what I can **extract** based on start and end points:

| Label | Start | End | Tick? |
| ----- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| A     | 1     | 3   | ✅     |
| B     | 3     | 7   | ❌     |
| C     | 2     | 9   | ❌     |
| D     | 6     | 10  | ✅     |
| E     | 8     | 11  | ❌     |
| F     | 8     | 12  | ❌     |
| G     | 12    | 14  | ✅     |
| H     | 15    | 18  | ✅     |

Let’s write the intervals only:

```
(1,3), (3,7), (2,9), (6,10), (8,11), (8,12), (12,14), (15,18)
```

---

### ✍️ Step 2: Greedy Strategy

Sort by **end time**:

| Interval | Ends At |
| -------- | ------- |
| (1,3)    | 3       |
| (3,7)    | 7       |
| (2,9)    | 9       |
| (6,10)   | 10      |
| (8,11)   | 11      |
| (8,12)   | 12      |
| (12,14)  | 14      |
| (15,18)  | 18      |

---

### ✨ Algorithm

Start with the earliest finishing class.

```cpp
last_end = -∞
count = 0
for each (start, end) in sorted list:
    if start >= last_end:
        count += 1
        last_end = end
```

---

### 📌 Walkthrough

Start `last_end = -∞`:

1. (1, 3) ✅ → fits → count = 1, `last_end = 3`
2. (3, 7) ✅ → 3 ≥ 3 → fits → count = 2, `last_end = 7`
3. (2, 9) ❌ → 2 < 7 → overlaps → skip
4. (6, 10) ❌ → 6 < 7 → skip
5. (8, 11) ✅ → 8 ≥ 7 → fits → count = 3, `last_end = 11`
6. (8, 12) ❌ → 8 < 11 → skip
7. (12, 14) ✅ → 12 ≥ 11 → fits → count = 4, `last_end = 14`
8. (15, 18) ✅ → 15 ≥ 14 → fits → count = 5, `last_end = 18`

---

### ✅ Final Selected Intervals

```
(1,3), (3,7), (8,11), (12,14), (15,18)
```

That’s **5 non-overlapping requests**.

---

### 🧠 Code Version (C++)

Here’s the **exact code** that solves this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Structure to store each activity's start and end time
struct Activity {
    int start;
    int end;
};

// Custom sorting: sort activities by their end time
bool compare(Activity a, Activity b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of activities: ";
    cin >> n;

    vector<Activity> activities(n);
    
    // Input the start and end times
    cout << "Enter start and end time of each activity:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> activities[i].start >> activities[i].end;
    }

    // Sort activities by end time
    sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), compare);

    // The first activity is always selected
    int count = 1;
    int last_end = activities[0].end;

    // Iterate through the rest of the activities
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // If the activity starts after the last selected one ends
        if (activities[i].start >= last_end) {
            count++;
            last_end = activities[i].end;  // Update last_end
        }
    }

    cout << "Maximum number of non-overlapping activities: " << count << endl;
    return 0;
}

```

### ✅ Summary

* You got the idea perfectly with your drawing!
* Using the **earliest end time** strategy is the correct greedy method.
* Your checkmarked boxes match exactly with the algorithm.

Would you like me to:

* Print the exact intervals selected in code?
* Make a colored version of your diagram showing what's picked/skipped?

Let me know!

.......................

### ✅ Let's use this sample input:

```
n = 6
Activities:
(1, 3)
(2, 4)
(3, 5)
(0, 6)
(5, 7)
(8, 9)
```

---

### ✅ Step-by-step code walkthrough:

#### \`\`\`cpp

\#include <iostream>
\#include <vector>
\#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

````
- Includes libraries for input/output, vectors (dynamic arrays), and sorting.

---

#### ```cpp
struct Activity {
    int start;
    int end;
};
````

* Defines a structure called `Activity` with `start` and `end` times.
* So each activity is represented as: `Activity{start, end}`.

---

#### \`\`\`cpp

bool compare(Activity a, Activity b) {
return a.end < b.end;
}

````

### 📌 What this does:
- This is a **custom comparison function** used for sorting.
- It tells `sort()` to **order activities by their `end` times**, in increasing order.

### 🔍 How `a` and `b` are passed:
- The C++ `sort()` function internally **calls `compare(a, b)`** for different pairs of activities to decide which should come first.

---

### 🔄 Example with your input:
Before sorting, activities are:

| Index | Start | End |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 0     | 1     | 3   |
| 1     | 2     | 4   |
| 2     | 3     | 5   |
| 3     | 0     | 6   |
| 4     | 5     | 7   |
| 5     | 8     | 9   |

#### Now `sort(...)` is called:
```cpp
sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), compare);
````

This sorts the activities **by end time**, using the `compare()` function.

#### 🧠 Internally:

`sort()` tries many comparisons like:

* compare( (1,3), (2,4) ) → 3 < 4 → true → (1,3) comes before (2,4)
* compare( (3,5), (0,6) ) → 5 < 6 → true → (3,5) before (0,6)
* compare( (5,7), (3,5) ) → 7 < 5 → false → (3,5) before (5,7)
* compare( (5,7), (8,9) ) → 7 < 9 → true → (5,7) before (8,9)

After all comparisons, sorted list becomes:

| Index | Start | End |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| 0     | 1     | 3   |
| 1     | 2     | 4   |
| 2     | 3     | 5   |
| 3     | 0     | 6   |
| 4     | 5     | 7   |
| 5     | 8     | 9   |

→ Now we’ll select max non-overlapping ones.

---

#### \`\`\`cpp

int count = 1;
int last\_end = activities\[0].end;

````

We always select the **first activity**, because it ends earliest.

🧠 So:
- count = 1
- last_end = 3 (from activity (1,3))

---

### ✅ Loop through rest and check if it can be selected:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (activities[i].start >= last_end) {
        count++;
        last_end = activities[i].end;
    }
}
````

Now check each activity from index 1 onward:

| i | Activity | start ≥ last\_end? | Result                   |
| - | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1 | (2, 4)   | 2 ≥ 3 → ❌          | Skip                     |
| 2 | (3, 5)   | 3 ≥ 3 → ✅          | count = 2, last\_end = 5 |
| 3 | (0, 6)   | 0 ≥ 5 → ❌          | Skip                     |
| 4 | (5, 7)   | 5 ≥ 5 → ✅          | count = 3, last\_end = 7 |
| 5 | (8, 9)   | 8 ≥ 7 → ✅          | count = 4, last\_end = 9 |

---

### ✅ Final output:

```cpp
cout << "Maximum number of non-overlapping activities: " << count << endl;
```

🖨️ Output:

```
Maximum number of non-overlapping activities: 4
```

---

### ✅ Final Answer Activities:

* (1,3)
* (3,5)
* (5,7)
* (8,9)

---

### Summary of what `sort(..., compare)` does:

* `compare(a, b)` helps sort **by ending time**, so we always try the activity that finishes earliest — making room for the next.
* Sorting this way is key to the greedy strategy.

---

Exactly — let me walk you through everything you're asking with **clear explanations**.

---

### 🧱 What is `activities`?

```cpp
vector<Activity> activities(n);
```

This creates a **vector of `Activity` structures** — basically, a list/array where each element has:

```cpp
struct Activity {
    int start;
    int end;
};
```

So each `activities[i]` has a `.start` and `.end` field.
You can imagine this like:

```cpp
activities = [
    {start: 1, end: 4},
    {start: 3, end: 5},
    {start: 0, end: 6},
    ...
];
```

---

### 🧭 What is `activities.begin()` and `activities.end()`?

These are **iterators**, which act like pointers to the beginning and end of the vector.

* `activities.begin()` → points to the **first element** in the vector
* `activities.end()` → points **just *after*** the last element

```cpp
sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), compare);
```

This tells `sort()`:

> Sort everything **from the first activity to the last**, using the `compare` function.

---

### 🧠 So, what happens internally?

The `sort()` function works like this:

1. It starts at `activities.begin()` and goes up to (but not including) `activities.end()`.
2. It takes **pairs** of elements from this range: let's say `Activity a` and `Activity b`.
3. Then it calls `compare(a, b)`:

   ```cpp
   bool compare(Activity a, Activity b) {
       return a.end < b.end;
   }
   ```
4. If this returns **true**, it keeps `a` before `b`.
5. If **false**, it swaps them.

And this process repeats until the whole list is sorted by **end time**.

### 📌 In short:

| Term                 | Meaning                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activities`         | A `vector` of structs like `{start: int, end: int}`                  |
| `activities.begin()` | Iterator pointing to the **first activity** in the vector            |
| `activities.end()`   | Iterator pointing **after the last activity** (non-inclusive)        |
| `compare(a, b)`      | Custom logic that says: **put the one with the smaller `end` first** |
