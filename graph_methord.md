Yes! Let's solve the **"maximum number of non-overlapping intervals (activities)"** using the **graph method**, though it's **not the most efficient way** (greedy is better), it's still a valid approach for understanding.

---

### 🧠 Problem Recap:

You are given `n` activities with start and end times. Select **maximum** number of activities that **do not overlap**.

---

### 🎯 Graph Method Idea:

Treat each activity as a **node** in a graph.

* Add an edge **from node A to B** if **Activity A ends before Activity B starts**.
* Then the problem becomes finding the **longest path** in this graph — because the longest path of non-overlapping activities gives us the max number we can attend.

This is a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) — since time is one-directional (no cycles possible).

---

### ✅ Steps:

1. Build the graph:

   * For each pair `(i, j)`, if `activities[i].end <= activities[j].start`, draw edge `i → j`.
2. Perform **Topological Sort** on the graph.
3. Apply **Longest Path in DAG** logic:

   * For each node, track the longest chain of non-overlapping activities ending at that node.

---

### 🧪 Example:

Suppose you have these activities:

| Activity | Start | End |
| -------- | ----- | --- |
| A0       | 1     | 3   |
| A1       | 2     | 5   |
| A2       | 4     | 7   |
| A3       | 6     | 9   |

---

### 🔧 Graph Building:

* A0 → A2 (1–3 and 4–7)
* A0 → A3 (1–3 and 6–9)
* A1 → A3 (2–5 and 6–9)
* A2 → A3 (4–7 and 6–9 ❌ invalid, overlapping, skip)

---

### 🎯 Topological Sort (say): A0, A1, A2, A3

Apply **Longest Path** logic:

* Initialize `dp[i] = 1` for all i (each node alone is a path of length 1).
* For each node u:

  * For all neighbors v:

    * If `dp[v] < dp[u] + 1`, update `dp[v] = dp[u] + 1`

After this, `max(dp)` gives max number of non-overlapping activities.

### 📌 C++ Code (Graph Method)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct Activity {
    int start, end;
};

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of activities: ";
    cin >> n;
    vector<Activity> activities(n);

    cout << "Enter start and end times:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> activities[i].start >> activities[i].end;
    }

    // Step 1: Build the graph
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    vector<int> indegree(n, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i != j && activities[i].end <= activities[j].start) {
                adj[i].push_back(j);
                indegree[j]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Topological Sort using Kahn's algorithm
    queue<int> q;
    vector<int> topo;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (indegree[i] == 0)
            q.push(i);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front(); q.pop();
        topo.push_back(u);
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            indegree[v]--;
            if (indegree[v] == 0)
                q.push(v);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Longest Path in DAG
    vector<int> dp(n, 1);  // Initially, each activity can be selected alone

    for (int u : topo) {
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);
        }
    }

    // Final answer
    int max_activities = *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    cout << "Maximum number of non-overlapping activities: " << max_activities << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
